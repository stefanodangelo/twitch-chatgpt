When Crocker has anything involved with Fairy Godparents or suspects there's one around him, or even says the word, Crocker spasms three times (each spasm spoken with "Fairy," "God," "Parents") while saying "Fairy godparents!"
Crocker is often considered as "crazy" due to his constant obsession with fairies.
In his early childhood, Crocker was kind, brave and handsome. Due to losing his fairies, he has crooked teeth, a hunched back and his ears on his neck. If Timmy hadn't affected the timeline, Crocker would have been a handsome college professor. He's mostly bitter about himself, and the world that mocks him. One of his goals is to achieve a New World Order, which he did for a short while anyway. Another goal of his is getting back on everyone who mocked him and said: "fairies aren't real." His obsession for fairies is so intense that it is used to power up the entire Fairy World, as seen in "Crocker Shocker." Although originally shown as a cruel, borderline insane megalomaniac, his personality has become more lonely and bitter rather than maniacal and is shown to wants to capture a fairy to prove he isn't a nut-job. He is more out to prove himself right, and fix his shattered life, than take over the universe, becoming a slightly more sympathetic character, although still the main antagonist. If Crocker hadn't stopped giving up fairies he would have lived in luxury with his crush Idaho (but even now he still turned her down). Although Crocker is mean and cold-hearted, he doesn't want to put a baby fairy's life at risk when he had actually captured a fairy. Crocker has also overlooked Cosmo and Wanda's fairy nature when encountering them outside of school and has voluntarily or forcibly commanded to divert from his fairy obsession to other penchants like leprechauns, trolls and tropical fowl.
